Machine Learning - Stanford University (Coursera) 
================

All projects have been implemented in MATLAB.

In this course, the following projects were implemented:

Neural Network to implement Digit Recognition in MATLAB

Spam Classifier using SVM

Compress an image with K-Means and used PCA to find a low dimensional representation of face images

Applied anomaly detection algorithm to detect failing servers on a network

Used collaborative filtering to implement recommender system for movies
